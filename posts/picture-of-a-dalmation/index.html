The difference lies in how cinema screens produce an image- one is based off of an image that was shot by a professional camera and projected onto a large screen, while most home screens only rely on images captured by your smartphone or computer. However, despite the differences, both types of pictures generally look good when displayed on a computer or phone.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://sunwalls.github.io/tags/wallpaper-list/>Wallpaper List</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://sunwalls.github.io/posts/pics-hot-model/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pics Hot Model - Indian Model Urvashi Rautela Looks Hot At Film Promotion</span></a>
