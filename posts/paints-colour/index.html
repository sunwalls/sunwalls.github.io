When you want to create a look that is professional and eye-catching on your website or blog, you can use background images. Background images can help give your content a cleaner, more modern look, while also adding some personality to your website or blog. Here are a few tips on how to create backgrounds that look great:</p><ol><li>Choose the right background image for your purpose.</li></ol><p>When choosing a background image, it is important to consider the purpose of the image. For example, if you are using a background image as part of an article headline, then the picture should be large and bold in order to stand out from other text. If you are using a background image for decoration on your website or blog, then the picture should be small and subtle in order not to distract from the content.</p><ol start=2><li>Use basic formatting techniques for backgrounds.</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://sunwalls.github.io/tags/wallpaper-list/>Wallpaper List</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://sunwalls.github.io/posts/owl-house-backgrounds/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Owl House Backgrounds : Winter Snow Scenes Berries Backgrounds Desktop Christmas Scene Snowy Trees Solstice Berry Nature 4u Wallpapers Holly Neige Background Cranberry Beauty</span></a>
